Local Chess Game
A simple, interactive chess game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This project allows users to play chess locally on their browser without needing an internet connection. 
It's designed for two players to play on the same device.

Features
Interactive chessboard: Drag and drop pieces or click to move them.
Two-player mode: Play with another person on the same device.
Responsive design: Works on various screen sizes.
Move validation: Ensures that pieces follow the rules of chess (such as piece-specific movement).
Check & Checkmate detection: Alerts players when the king is in check or checkmate.
Technologies Used
HTML5: For structuring the game interface and chessboard.
CSS3: For styling the game interface and making it responsive.
JavaScript: For game logic, movement, and interaction handling.

Usage
When you open the game, the chessboard will be displayed.
To move a piece, either click on the piece you want to move and then click on the destination square, 
or drag the piece to the destination square.
The game will automatically detect check and checkmate scenarios.
The game does not have AI, so it's designed for two players playing on the same device.
